// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND SERVICE
/**
 * Service Description: AutoML Prediction API.
 *
 * <p>On any input that is documented to expect a string parameter in snake_case or kebab-case,
 * either of those cases is accepted.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (PredictionServiceClient predictionServiceClient = PredictionServiceClient.create()) {
 *   ModelName name = ModelName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]", "[MODEL]");
 *   ExamplePayload payload = ExamplePayload.newBuilder().build();
 *   Map&lt;String, String&gt; params = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
 *   PredictResponse response = predictionServiceClient.predict(name, payload, params);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the predictionServiceClient object to clean up resources
 * such as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls
 * close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of PredictionServiceSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * PredictionServiceSettings predictionServiceSettings =
 *     PredictionServiceSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * PredictionServiceClient predictionServiceClient =
 *     PredictionServiceClient.create(predictionServiceSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * PredictionServiceSettings predictionServiceSettings =
 *     PredictionServiceSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * PredictionServiceClient predictionServiceClient =
 *     PredictionServiceClient.create(predictionServiceSettings);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
